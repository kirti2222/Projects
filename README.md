#  Crime Trend Analysis & Resolution Report
## Project Objective:
To provide a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of crime to support strategic decision-making in law enforcement and public safety.
## Project Questions:
1 What is the total number of crimes recorded, and how has this number changed over the past few years (2021-2023)?
2 What is the crime resolution rate, and how effective are the efforts of the authorities in resolving crimes?
3 Which days of the week have the highest and lowest crime rates?
4 Which months of the year see the most significant spikes or dips in crime?
5 What are the "dangerous" and "safer" times of day in terms of crime frequency?
6 What is the geographical distribution of crimes by country?
7 Which types of crimes are most prevalent during specific time frames?
The dashboard aims to track and improve several key performance indicators (KPIs) related to crime analysis:
1.	Total Crimes: The overall number of crimes recorded.
2.	Crimes by Year: The trend in crime numbers over different years.
3.	Resolution Rate: The percentage of crimes that are successfully resolved by authorities.
4.	Crimes by Time and Day: The frequency of crimes based on the time of day and day of the week, which can help in resource allocation.
5.	Crimes by Type: The distribution of different types of crimes to identify the most prevalent offenses.
## Project Process
The project involved the following steps:
1.	Data Collection: Gathering raw crime data, likely from law enforcement agencies, which includes details such as crime type, date, time, and resolution status.
2.	Data Transformation: Cleaning and structuring the collected data to make it suitable for analysis. This might involve handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new columns (e.g., extracting the day of the week from a date).
3.	Dashboard Design: Developing the visual layout in Power BI, including charts, graphs, and filters, to present the data in an easily digestible format. The design focuses on displaying trends, patterns, and key metrics.
4.	Analysis and Interpretation: Analyzing the generated visualizations to derive insights, such as identifying crime hotspots, peak times, and the effectiveness of resolution efforts.
5.	Final Report Generation: Compiling all the findings into a comprehensive report for stakeholders, including the main dashboard, specific analyses, and a summary of conclusions.
## Project Insights
The dashboard reveals several key insights:
1	Total Crimes: The total number of crimes recorded is 2500.
2	Crime Trends: There was a significant increase in total crimes from 2021 to 2022 (from 405 to 1150), followed by a decrease in 2023 (to 945).
3	Resolution Rate: The overall resolution rate for crimes is 70.04%, with 29.96% of crimes remaining unresolved.
4	Daily and Monthly Patterns: Saturdays and Mondays have the highest crime totals, and October and November show a significant spike in crimes.
5	Crime Time and Type: The time from 12:00 AM to 2:59 AM is identified as a "dangerous time," with the most prevalent crimes during this period being "Violence and S..." and "Anti-Social Beh...". The safest time during this range is around 1:00 AM.
## Final Conclusion
The project successfully created a Power BI dashboard that provides a clear and actionable overview of crime data. The analysis shows that while authority efforts have led to a high-resolution rate, the total number of crimes remains a concern, with specific periods and types of crimes requiring more targeted intervention. The dashboard effectively visualizes crime patterns, highlighting a decrease in total crimes in 2023 but also a significant portion of unresolved cases. The insights into specific days, months, and times of increased criminal activity can be used to inform strategic decisions, such as increasing police presence during identified peak times like late night/early morning and specific months like October and November, to help reduce the number of crimes and further improve the resolution rate.
