## Project Process
The project involved the following steps:
1.	Data Collection: Gathering raw crime data that includes details such as crime type, date, time, and resolution status.
2.	Data Transformation: Cleaning and structuring the collected data to make it suitable for analysis. This involves handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new columns. For Example: extracting time groups from the crime time.
3.	Dashboard Design: Developing the visual layout in Power BI, including charts, graphs, and filters, to present the data in an easily understandable format. The design focuses on displaying trends, patterns, and key metrics.
4.	Analysis and Interpretation: Analyzing the generated visualizations to derive insights, such as identifying crime hotspots, peak times, and the effectiveness of resolution efforts.
5.	Final Report Generation: Compiling all the findings into a comprehensive report for stakeholders, including the main dashboard and a summary of conclusions.
The dashboard aims to reveal several key insights:
1. Total Crimes are 2500 and there is a significant increase in the crime rates from 2021 to 2022 nd then decrease in 2023.
2. The overall resolution rate is 70.04% with 29.96% of crimes unresolved.
3. Saturdays and Mondays have the highest crime totals and October and November are the peak months for higher rate of crimes.
4. The dangerous time is identified as 12:00 AM and safer time is identified as 1:00 AM for the 12:00 AM to 2:59 AM Time Group with Violence and Sexual crimes at the top followed by Anti-Social Behaviour and Public Order.
