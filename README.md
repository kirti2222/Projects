# Project Title: Crime Trend Analysis and Resolution Report
## Project Objective: 
To provide a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of crime to support strategic decision making for law enforcement and public safety.
## Dataset Used
https://github.com/kirti2222/Projects/blob/main/Crimes%20Data.xlsx
https://github.com/kirti2222/Projects/blob/main/Other%20Data.xlsx
## Project Questions
1. What is the total number of crimes recorded and how has this number changed over the past few years?
2. What is the crime resolution rate and how effective are the efforts of the authorities in resolving crimes?
3. Which days of the week have the highest and lowest crime rates?
4. Which months of the year have the highest and lowest crime rates?
5. What are the dangerous and safer times of the day in terms of time frequency?
6. What is the geographical distribution of crimes by country?
7. Which crimes are most prevalent during specific time frames?
## Project Process
The project involved the following steps:
1.	Data Collection: Gathering raw crime data that includes details such as crime type, date, time, and resolution status.
2.	Data Transformation: Cleaning and structuring the collected data to make it suitable for analysis. This involves handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new columns. For Example: extracting time groups from the crime time.
3.	Dashboard Design: Developing the visual layout in Power BI, including charts, graphs, and filters, to present the data in an easily understandable format. The design focuses on displaying trends, patterns, and key metrics.
4.	Analysis and Interpretation: Analyzing the generated visualizations to derive insights, such as identifying crime hotspots, peak times, and the effectiveness of resolution efforts.
5.	Final Report Generation: Compiling all the findings into a comprehensive report for stakeholders, including the main dashboard and a summary of conclusions.
The dashboard aims to reveal several key insights:
1. Total Crimes are 2500 and there is a significant increase in the crime rates from 2021 to 2022 and then decrease in 2023.
2. The overall resolution rate is 70.04% with 29.96% of crimes unresolved.
3. Saturdays and Mondays have the highest crime totals and October and November are the peak months for higher rate of crimes.
4. The dangerous time is identified as 12:00 AM and safer time is identified as 1:00 AM for the 12:00 AM to 2:59 AM Time Group with Violence and Sexual crimes at the top followed by Anti-Social Behaviour and Public Order.

## Final Conclusion
The project successfully created a Power BI dashboard that provides a clear and actionable overview of crime data. The analysis shows that while authority efforts have led to a high-resolution rate, the total number of crimes remains a concern, with specific periods and types of crimes requiring more targeted arbitration. The dashboard effectively visualizes crime patterns, highlighting a decrease in total crimes in 2023 but also a significant portion of unresolved cases.The identified crime hot spot is Austria that needs further attention to improve its crimininal activities resolution rate.The insights into specific days, months, and times of increased criminal activity can be used to inform strategic decisions such as increasing police presence during identified peak times like late night/early morning and specific months like October and November to help reduce the number of crimes and further improve the resolution rate.
